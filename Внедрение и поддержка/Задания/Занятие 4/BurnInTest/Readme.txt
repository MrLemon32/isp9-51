TESTS

- New GPGPU test:
  - The GPGPU test exercises and verifies the GPU's General Purpose computing 
    operations (rather than 3D type operations). The GPGPU tests are a bit like 
    the CPU tests, but the tests are run on the GPU. The GPGPU test load is 
    user selectable. 
  - The GPGPU test runs on all detected GPUs (to a maximum of 8 GPUs). The GPUs 
    that are being tested are listed in the GPGPU test window. 
	  
- New Webcam test:
  - Added an integrated Webcam test to BurnInTest Pro. This test allows a 
    Webcam display window to be opened as a pre-test. BurnInTest will report 
    errors opening the Webcam window and the user can also report a visual 
    display error (via a button). Scripting commands have been added to support 
    this feature, e.g.:
      SETTEST WEBCAM, UNSETTEST WEBCAM, RUN WEBCAM

- New battery test
  - Added an integrated Battery test to BurnInTest Pro. This test checks the 
    battery levels in absolute or percentage terms. These checks can be carried 
    out before the main tests, and/or during the main tests. Scripting commands 
    have been added to support this feature, e.g.:
      SETBATTERY PRE_TEST YES MAIN_TEST YES USE_THRESHOLD YES THRESHOLD 30000 
      SETBATTERY PRE_TEST YES MAIN_TEST NO USE_PERC_THRESHOLD YES PERC_THRESHOLD 95 

- New Microphone test 
  - Added an integrated Microphone test to BurnInTest Pro. This test allows a 
    microphone test window to be opened as a pre-test. The test allows 20 seconds 
    of audio to be recorded via the microphone that can then be played back to 
    verify the Microphone input is OK. BurnInTest will report errors opening the 
    Microphone input and the user can also report an audio error (via a button).
      SETTEST MICROPHONE, UNSETTEST MICROPHONE, RUN MICROPHONE

- Improved the CPU test:
  - Added a new CPU test for AES. Scripting updated to allow AES testing.
    SETCPU AES YES

- Improved the Memory test:
  - BurnInTest can now monitor and report low level hardware errors, like 
    corrected ECC memory errors, CPU and PCI-E errors, based on the Microsoft 
    Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA). 

- Improved the Disk test:
  - Increased the default Disk test duty cycle from 50% to 100%.
  - Added larger disk test block size options from 2MB to 64MB. In many cases 
    this allows faster testing. 
  - Increased the Blocksize default from 0.25MB to 4MB.
  - Optimized the Sequential, HighLow and Random test patterns to reduce the 
    time required to test a disk and to increase load.
  - Added a user defined test pattern (eg: 55AA or F0F0) where one user defined 
    test pattern can be specified. Added scripting commands to support this, e.g:
      SETDISK DISK c: MODE userdefined BLOCK 65536
      SETDISK USERPATTERN 00AA00AA00AA00AA
  - Added a Physical disk read test, that tests that all sectors on the physical 
    disk can be read. This can be useful for a number of reasons including 
    testing that a disk is the size that it reports it is (we have seen disks and 
    UFDs that have this issue).
  - The mechanism to calculate the disk test throughput (MB/sec) and to trigger 
    the Slow Disk Threshold has been improved. 
  - Corrected a Disk test crash bug with the High/Low test mode.
  - Changed the description of Automatically select disk drives to better reflect 
    that SSDs are also selected with this option (not just hard disks).

- Improved the Standard Network test:
  - Increased the number of Network ports that can be tested from 12 to 20.
    Changed scripting to support these options, e.g.:
      SETNETWORK  ADD13 "192.168.0.13"
  - Improvement to the verification of the IPv6 Standard network test packet.
  - When an error ratio is specified with the standard network test, the number 
    of packets required before the ratio is considered to be meaningful has been 
    increased.
  - Preferences->Network now warns that at least 1 destination address must be 
    specified.

- Improved the Bluetooth test:
  - Bluetooth updated to work with more recent devices, e.g. Nexus 5. 
    Specifically, if the "File Transfer" profile is not found on the Bluetooth
    device, BurnInTest will now attempt to connect to the device using its 
    address and a range of ports.
  - Improved the error message when a connection to the device fails.

- Improved the Advanced Network test:
  - Added an automatic detection and testing of Network Adapters option in the 
    Advanced Network test. This allows easier testing across systems with 
    different network card configurations.
  - Optimized the Advanced network test to provide a greater load with lower CPU 
    utilization (i.e. test higher network loads). Also, increased the default 
    Advanced Network Block size from 1000 to 16384 to increase the default 
    Network load.
  - Better support for systems with VMWare or VirtualBox installed (Network 
    port detection).

- Improved the Sound loopback test:
  - The Sound loopback test has been changed from mono to stereo. BurnInTest
    now plays a stereo waveform and records and analyses each channel. The left 
    and right channel waveforms are displayed in the test window and errors are 
    reported for either the left or right channel.
  - Very short tests are now possible (e.g. to verify correct cabling) down to 
    about 4 seconds (by setting a duration of less than 30 seconds, and the 
    number of cycles to 1. 
  - Sound preferences now displays the waveform capable input and output 
    devices on the system, to make it easy to determine which is the default 
    device (0), and what will be used for the test.
  - The output device is now selectable using BurnInTest scripting, via e.g.
    SETSOUND TEST LOOPBACK DEVICEOUT "Speaker". BurnInTest 7.x and earlier use 
    the default output device.

- Improved the 3D test:    
  - Higher load through higher resolution textures and 3D objects. Improved the 
    test for Intel integrated graphics cards.

- Improved the USB test:
  - The USB 3.0 Loopback test has been changed to use a larger burst length to 
    increase the USB system loading.
  - Improvements to detecting PassMark USB 3.0 Loopback plugs in some scenarios.

- Improved the Video Playback test:
  - Additional error information now reported for the Video Playback test.
  - Corrected a Video playback test crash bug that could occur in rare scenarios 
    at the end of a video clip.

    VT8237S chipset. Added support for enabling SMBus on the Intel X79 Express 
    Chipset. Fixed incorrect decoding of number of banks in DDR2FB SPD that 
    caused the memory stick size to be reported incorrectly.
  - Changed the memory module number in the system information to be 0-based.
  - If BurnInTest failed to collect Memory SPD information from some systems, it 
    was possible that BurnInTest would try forever. This would not allow the user
    to enter preferences. This has been corrected.

  - Added reporting on Battery information to BurnInTest Pro (without the need 
    of BatteryMon).

  - Fixed a crash bug on start-up when collecting system information on a system 
    with a very large number of disks.
  - Rare crash on collecting Disk SMART information fixed.

REPORTING
- The test configuration details can now be saved to a text report (File->Save 
  Test Configuration Text As...) or to an Activity level 1 trace log file. 
  This can help record the test configuration of a test run or be used to check 
  the test configuration.
- A statistics report has been added to log test monitoring data in a CSV (Comma 
  Separated Variable) format for post test analysis. Currently this includes 
  data logging for temperature, fans* and voltage*. *3rd party HMonitor or 
  SpeedFan software is required to monitor fans and voltage.
- Temperature reporting and graphing now supported down to -50C (previously above 
  0C) where supported by the temperature source.
- Added fields to the Customer Test Certificate: System model, Motherboard 
  manufacturer and Motherboard serial number.

OTHER IMPROVEMENTS

  tests. For example, a webcam pre-test and touchscreen plugin pre-test may be 
  run with no other tests. Post test actions will occur after the Pre-tests if 
  there are no main tests to run.
- On double clicking a result on the Results window, if there is no error 
  then the test description in help is displayed instead of the error 
  descriptions.
- Background watermark on System Information page, so that at a glance it is obvious 
  whether BurnInTest V7.x or V8.x is running.

  value for the "SPEED" component was not recognised
- Fixed a display issue where if "Automatically select temperature sources"
  was unchecked but temperature sources were still selected the temperature 
  line on the results tab would not be displayed
- Fixed a crash caused by a timing issue when collecting system information
  where the number of DIMM slots could be an invalid value
- Fixed a bug preventing the DVD test from starting correctly
  
Release 7.0 build 1015
WIN32 release 19 September 2012
WIN64 release 19 September 2012
- Added a "Ignore "no operations" timeout" option to the plugins 
  so no timeout warnings will be logged
- Changed behaviour so that the test preferences cannot be changed
  if BurnInTest is still collecting system information at startup 
- Changed behaviour so test start time is not recorded until after 
  pre test plugins have finished. Previously the start time was recorded
  when the plugins started and the total test time was applied to them as well
- Fixed a bug in the physical (raw) disk test where the random data with 
  random seeking test could generate an incorrect data verify error
- Fixed a bug where the plugin name could be truncated in the log
- Fixed a case where DirectIO.sys could not be loaded correctly on
  some versions of Windows

Release 7.0 build 1014
WIN32 release 1 August 2012
WIN64 release 1 August 2012
- Made some changes to the plugins test options to allow up to 5
  pre test plugins to be run (PRO only)
- Added a new plugin option to specify whether to run plugins all
  at the same time or on after the other (PRO only)
- Added new plugins to PRO edition (battery capacity, webcam, 
  microphone and sound)

Release 7.0 build 1013
WIN32 release 31 May 2012

  to text and HTML logs

Release 7.0 build 1012
WIN32 release 8 May 2012
- Corrected a problem where some system information could not be collected on 
  32-bit XP. This problem was introduced in 7.0.1010 - removed System information 
  compatibilty with other PassMark applications.

Release 7.0 build 1011
WIN32 release 26 April 2012
WIN64 release 26 April 2012
- The temperature threshold could be used with the wrong temperature source. 
  This has been corrected.
- Other minor changes.

Release 7.0 build 1010
WIN32 release 4 April 2012
WIN64 release 4 April 2012
- System information updates for Intel and AMD CPUs. 
- Reduced the CPU information collection time on very slow CPUs.
- Workaround for the AMD Llano (12h series) CPU for determining overclocked CPU
  frequencies. Many of these CPUs are meant to have locked multipliers, but 
  in many cases they are not locked and in this case there appears to be a 
  CPU/BIOS issue that leads to the locked CPU frequency being reported, rather 
  than the configured CPU frequency.
- BurnInTest is now compatible with other PassMark applications including 
  PerformanceTest, RamMon and OSForensics. Previously, while monitoring 
  temperature with BurnInTest, some functions, like collecting certain system 
  information, were not available in PerformanceTest etc.
- Spelling corrections.
- Minor help file improvements.

- PC Test Kit build.

Release 7.0 build 1005 rev 2
WIN32 release 5 December 2011
WIN64 release 5 December 2011
- Added a new command line parameter, -n [minimum volume size in MB], to allow 
  the automatic disk test selection to exclude disk volumes less than a specified 
  size. This could be useful to exclude the System reserved partition on an SSD
  under WinPE.
- Correction to the CPU test if the CPU frequency cannot be detected (very rare 
  bug).
- Minor change to the GPU temperature collection.

Release 7.0 build 1005 rev 1

Release 7.0 build 1005 rev 0
WIN32 release 21 November 2011
WIN64 release 21 November 2011
- Tuned the memory test allocation when run with the disk test to avoid the 
  disk test running out of memory.

Release 7.0 build 1004 rev 9
WIN32 release 10 November 2011
WIN64 release 10 November 2011
- Corrected a bug where the Preferences->Post test application field didn't 
  work when command line parameters were specified with the application.
- Corrected a problem with the BurnInTest Standard 3D test where on some 
  systems it would not run and would display an DirectX initialization problem. 
  This was not a problem with BurnInTest Pro.
- Corrected a bug where in some cases BurnInTest could report the wrong disk as 
  an SSD.
- Corrected a bug where BurnInTest could incorrectly determine the number of 
  partitions on a raw disk that had previously been tested by the BurnInTest 
  physical disk test. This could cause subsequent physical disk tests on this 
  drive to fail. 
- When starting BurnInTest with the command line parameter to reduce the amount 
  of system information that is collected, -w, the waiting for system 
  information window could still be displayed in some cases. This has been 
  corrected.
- When running on WinPE or Bootable BurnInTest, the physical disks that 
  can be tested are now explicitly restricted to raw disks. Previously this 
  limitation was only documented. 
- Bootable BurnInTest (part of the PC Test Kit and Bootable USB Flash Drive 
  products) does not support the following tests and as such these tests have 
  been greyed out in the Test selection window: 2D, 3D, Video Playback, Sound, 
  Printer and Tape. Previously this limitation was only documented. These 
  limitations do not apply to BurnInTest when run from an installed operating 
  system.
- A very small number of USB drives have been found to cause BurnInTest to hang 
  when collecting disk information. These would appear to be faulty drives. 
  However, as they can cause BurnInTest to hang, especially on starting tests 
  with automatic temperature monitoring on, entering Preferences->Disk or 
  Preferences->Temp, changes have been made to work-around this problem. These 
  changes include the addition of timeout for a range of drive queries and the 
  removal of hot pluggable (USB) drives from the automatic temperature source 
  selection.
- Corrected a bug where in rare cases BurnInTest could crash when Activity level 
  2 trace logging is selected and when BurnInTest reads an event from a very 
  large Windows System or Application event log.
- Tuned the memory test to improve memory allocation on test startup.
- Improved the error location information for writing and reading to a physical 
  disk.   
- Improved BurnInTest software exception handling to produce a mini-dump debug 
  file in more cases.
- Minor logging and documentation changes.

Release 7.0 build 1003 rev 5
WIN32 release 20 October 2011
WIN64 release 20 October 2011
- Corrected the Standard network test preferences for Bad packet ratios.
- Corrected the Advanced network test preferences for Half and Full duplex.
- Corrected the Advanced network test where a disabled IPv6 network interface 
  could be incorrectly displayed in preferences.
- Correct a crash on startup when collecting PCI information on a specific 
  system.
- Change to the 3D font error handling to prevent a crash during the 3D test 
  a particular system.
- Attempt to correct a crash with GPU temperature monitoring.
- Added the raw dump of sound wave samples on certain errors when level 2 
  activity trace logging is selected.
- Improved event logging: remove a duplicate event, moved a trace level event 
  from normal level to level 1 trace event logging, and Plugins can now report 
  an event of severity "NONE".
- Minor improvements to the help file.

Release 7.0 build 1002
WIN32 release 22 September 2011
WIN64 release 22 September 2011
- BurnInTest 7.0 now supports Windows 8 developer preview.
- BurnInTest now uses the PassMark SysInfo SDK to get temperature information.
- The "Collecting system information" progress window was displayed when the 
  "-w" command line parameter was specified (to minimize the amount of system 
  information collected). This has been corrected.
- The "-a" command line parameter has been removed as it does not make sense 
  with BurnInTest 7.0 being run with elevated administrator privileges. 
  Use "-w" to minimize the amount of system information collected.
- BurnInTest could crash on the optical disk test when run with non-PassMark 
  test media, e.g. when run with a DVD video. This has been corrected.
- BurnInTest could crash on startup on a small number of systems when run in 
  debug mode. i.e. only when run with the "-u" command line parameter. This has 
  been corrected.

Release 7.0 build 1001
WIN32 release 14 September 2011
WIN64 release 14 September 2011

NEW TESTS and IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING TESTS
Touch screen test:
- BurnInTest now supports the testing of touch screens using the separate 
  PassMark MonitorTest product as a Pre-test plugin. PassMark MonitorTest 
  allows single touch tests and multi touch pan, zoom, rotate and tap 
  gesture tests.

CPU test improvements:
- The number of CPUs (Packages x cores x threads) that can be tested has 
  been increased to 256 (where supported by the Operating System). That is,
  CPUs across multiple processor groups can be tested.
- It is now possible to raise an error on a user defined CPU temperature 
  threshold being exceeded. It is also possible to automatically stop 
  testing in this scenario.
- The duration of the individual CPU tests have been balanced to provide 
  better coverage of some SIMD CPU instructions.
- Improvements to CPU test memory allocation mean memory allocation errors 
  that may have been reported as out of memory CPU errors are now not reported 
  as CPU errors, but more likely as memory errors.

Memory test improvements:
- The memory tests have been optimized to test with higher loads on memory and 
  to run more quickly.
- A new memory adjacency cell test is now included to help detect more memory 
  errors where accessing a memory cell changes the value of an adjacent memory 
  cell. 
- The memory test display has been improved to display write and read speed for 
  the Standard memory test and to not display any previous test results when 
  starting a new test.
- The ability to investigate system issues after an event that crashes BurnInTest 
  (like a driver crashing BurnInTest) has been improved. Specifically, in V6.0 
  the memory test could continue to run if BurnInTest had an unrecoverable 
  error, this could make the system less responsive during post failure 
  investigation.

Disk test improvements:
- Added new disk self tests, short and extended. These are a set of built-in 
  routines implemented by the vendor to perform failure diagnostics on the 
  disk. They can report disk errors such as a failure:
  - of the electrical element,
  - of the servo and/or seek test element,
  - of the read element,
  - due to handling damage.
- SMART monitoring and reporting is now available on many external drives 
  (previously only available on internal drives).
- SMART reporting for disks is now supported when running a physical disk test 
  (previously only available on a disk volume test).
- The physical disk test is now available on formatted disks (that do not 
  contain Windows installations or paging files). In V6.0 the physical disk test 
  was only available on unformatted disks.
- A new disk test mode, Quick physical drive test, is now available for the 
  physical disk test. This tests the most important parts of the physical disk 
  and a random selection of the remainder of the disk. This provides for much 
  quicker disk testing.
- It is now possible to raise an error on a user defined Hard disk temperature 
  threshold being exceeded. It is also possible to automatically stop testing 
  in this scenario.
- Hard disk temperature monitoring is now supported on many external drives 
  (previously only available on internal drives).
- The floppy disk (A:) has been removed from the default disk preference 
  selection.

Standard Network test:
- Changed the Standard Network test to have two types of tests (1) Internal 
  loopback or (2) a test of all available Network ports. The preferences User 
  Interface has been simplified. This overcomes timeouts that could be reported
  with the previous test when "Test all available Network ports" was set to 
  "No".
- Test up to 12 NICs (up from 6).
- Test IPv6 on Windows Vista and later (as well as IPv4). 
- The Standard network test duty cycle load is now more linear (in V6.0 100% 
  duty cycle was significantly higher load than 99%).
- The default timeout has been increased from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.

Advanced Network test:
- Test up to 12 NICs (up from 6).
- Select to test from up to 20 local NICs (up from 10).
- Test can now test IPv6 on Windows Vista and later (as well as IPv4). 
  Note: BurnInTest and the Endpoints must support IPv4.
- The test window now displays all of the NICs being tested and its Endpoint.
- The test preferences now includes a Display Endpoints option to make it 
  clearer the number of endpoints currently available for testing.
- A low throughput threshold value can now be specified to raise a throughput 
  error.

Optical drive test improvements:
- The Optical disk configuration file is now portable across systems where the 
  optical drive configuration is different. 
- The number of Optical drive tests has been increased from 20 to 26.
- If Select all available drives is selected and the automatic detection of 
  optical drives determines there are no drives, then the optical drive test is 
  turned off.

2D test improvements:
- 2D video memory test cycle count definition has been changed so that 1 cycle 
  represents 1 full pass of the video test memory.

USB test improvements:
- Test up to 25 USB ports with the PassMark USB 2.0 Loopback plug (up from 10). 
  This also requires V7.0 of the USB 2.0 Loopback plug device driver.
- A new option to auto detect the number of USB plugs connected has been added. 
  There must be at least 1 plug for the test.
- The PassMark USB 2.0 Loopback plug is now compatible with other USB products 
  from other vendors. BurnInTest 7.0 supports USB testing when these other USB 
  devices are connected. Specifically, a 3rd party USB device uses the same 
  internal name as the USB 2.0 Loopback plug (with V6.1 of the device driver and 
  earlier) which meant that that USB device needed to be removed before USB 
  testing could be conducted with BurnInTest.

Sound Loopback test:
- Changed the Sound loopback test mechanism to use longer sampling durations. 
  This resolves a problem where the test could report false positives when the 
  CPU is under heavy load.

Serial Port test:
- The BurnInTest serial port test has been changed to configure the COM ports when
  run from Microsoft WinPE 3.0 so that the COM ports can be tested.

Video Playback test:
- Added a default test video file (300x168) for Video Playback if no other video 
  files are available or selected.

Temperature:
- A new Temperature tab has been added to allow the monitoring of temperature 
  over the test period. 
- Temperature can be monitored and reported for 6 temperature sources 
  (up from 3).
- Temperature can now be graphed for 6 temperature sources.
- Temperature sources can now be automatically selected by BurnInTest.
- Temperature can be monitored and reported for some nVIDIA and AMD GPUs (as 
  well as CPU and Hard disks).
- Temperature reporting included for new AMD CPUs (APUs).
- Temperature monitoring for Intel Core 2 CPUs (as well as later Intel CPUs).
- The final test temperatures are now displayed after the test has completed 
  (and reset on start of tests).
- The frequency temperature values that are to be sampled can now be specified. 
  The sampling now occurs regardless of which tab is displayed (previously the 
  Results tab needed to be displayed).
- It is now possible to raise an error on a user defined CPU, hard disk and GPU 
  temperature threshold being exceeded. It is also possible to automatically 
  stop testing in this scenario.
- Hard disk temperature monitoring is now supported on many external drives 
  (previously only available on internal drives).
- Selecting the Maximum CPU temperature as a Quicktest no longer turns off 
  temperature monitoring.
- Changed the CPU Quicktests to monitor CPU temperature only (if available). 
  Changed the 2D and 3D Quicktests to monitor GPU temperature (if available). 
  Changed the Disk Quicktests to monitor Disk temperature (if available)
- Changed the temperature preferences to validate temperature values for disks
  before allowing them to be selected.

AUTOMATION
- Scripting has been extended to allow many common preference settings to be 
  set. Specifically, the following new scripting commands have been added:
  - SETCPU
  - SETDISK
  - SETDEFAULTPREFERENCES
  - SETERRORS
  - SETNETWORK
  - SETOPTICALDISK
  - SETPRETEST
  - SETPOSTTEST
  - SETRAM
  - SETSERIALPORTS
  - SETPARALLELPORTS
  - SETSOUND
  - SETUSB
  - SETVIDEOPLAYBACK
  - SET2DGRAPHICS
  - SETLOG (options have been expanded)
- BurnInTest can now be signaled to stop (and exit) by an external application. 
- If a script file does not exist in the My Documents directory and no path is 
  specified an error message is now displayed.
- The Pre-test, launch application and don't wait now uses the default directory 
  (like the wait version) for configuration and scripting.
- Documented a command line parameter to set the screen resolution on starting 
  BurnInTest, intended for use with Microsoft WinPE.
 
NEW SYSTEM INFORMATION
- Updates for newer CPU and GPU models.
- Improved maximum CPU speed measurement.
- Improved the RAM module information that is displayed and reported. Detailed 
  RAM SPD module information is now available with trace file logging.
- System information summary now displays SSD's separately from HDD's.
- System information now displays USB 3.0 host controllers and the devices on 
  the hubs behind these host controllers.
- In the case that 2 GPUs from different vendors were installed, it was possible 
  that the description for one of these was incorrect. This has been changed.
- When BurnInTest is run on WinPE 3.x, BurnInTest did not report the COM ports 
  in the System Information section. This has been changed.
- Corrected the Video Card chip type description where gibberish could be 
  displayed after the description string.
 
REPORTING
- More than one report type can now be automatically saved, i.e. text, HTML and 
  the customer certificate can now all be selected.
- The trace file format can now be selected (rather than being the same format 
  as the main report file). Specifically if the report is HTML, the trace file 
  can be text (which is easier to analyze).
- Increased the length of report event lines from 100 characters to 200 
  characters. In particular the report line length was previously truncated for 
  some customer Plugins and Windows systems events.
- Changed the Logging Preferences, Clear results and append to existing log 
  file, option (which was creating a new log file for each test run).
- Copying text or HTML to the Clipboard will now copy both formats to the 
  clipboard such that a subsequent paste will be either text or HTML, 
  depending on the application.

GENERAL
- Improved support for not Latin (e.g. English) character sets. While BurnInTest 
  is in English, some information collected from the system or entered by the 
  user may now use non-Latin character sets.
- BurnInTest has been changed to run with elevated administrator privileges as 
  this is required for some tests and quite a lot of system information. This 
  also allows temperature monitoring to be turned on by default.
- The "FAIL" definition has been changed to include critical, serious and warning 
  events, but now exclude information level events.
- All events may now be configured to not be reported if they are not meaningful 
  in a specific test environment (by setting to NONE in 
  BITErrorClassifications.txt).
- A "preferences editor" mode has been added to create test configurations for 
  just about any system, without needing the hardware (e.g. configure hard disk 
  to be tested that are not on the local system).
  Specifically, when specifying the command line parameter "Y": 
  - All HDD drive letters [A..Z] and physical disk numbers [0..99] are displayed 
    and allowed in Preferences->Disk; 
  - all optical disk drive letters [A..Z] are added to Preferences->Disk; 
  - CPU instructions not supported on the current system, are selectable. 
  - Files are not validated for existence: Plugin, sound, logging, video 
    playback, pre/ post test.
- Improved the look of the Event log window, making it easier to review the 
  events. This includes:
  - The removal of the limit of displaying 1000 events.
  - Sorting of events based on their severity, time, source and description.
  - A contextual popup menu for clearing results and copying events to the 
    clipboard.
  - Double clicking an event will now display a description of the common 
    errors.
- Improved the look of the Result log window, making it easier to review the 
  results. This includes:
  - Sorting of events based on their test name, cycles, operations, errors
    and last error description.
  - A contextual popup menu for clearing results and copying events to the 
    clipboard.
- Reduced the start-up time on newer Intel CPUs.
- Changed the Disk, Optical drive and USB preference windows for consistency.
- The retry timeouts for some error types has been standardized.
- Removed a directory does not exist warning message from Preferences->Logging 
  when the directory of the log file is the root directory of a drive.
- Changed the internal handling of the Windows 2D GUI test such that it is 
  de-linked from the main BurnInTest Window and the main Window can now be 
  moved while this test is running.
- Changed the definition of Cycles for the 3D, Network, Video Playback and USB 
  tests to better balance the cycle count across tests.
- Add launch of cmd.exe option from BIT menu when running in WinPE.
- Other minor improvements and bug corrections.
- Help updates.
